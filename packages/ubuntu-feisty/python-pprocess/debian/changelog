pprocess (0.5-0ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * Added proper support in the Exchange class for
    continuous communications between processes, providing
    examples: simple_continuous_queue.py and the
    concurrency-sig directory.
  * Changed the Map class to permit incremental access to
    received results from completed parts of the sequence of
    inputs, also adding an iteration interface.
  * Added an example, simple_pmap_iter.py, to demonstrate
    iteration over maps.
  * Fixed the get_number_of_cores function to work with
    /proc/cpuinfo where the "physical id" field is missing.
  * Tidied the Exchange class, adding distinct status
    methods: unfinished and busy.

pprocess (0.4-0ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * Added support for persistent/background processes.
  * Added a utility function to detect and return the number
    of processor cores available.
  * Added missing documentation stylesheet.
  * Added support for Solaris using pipes instead of socket
    pairs, since the latter do not apparently work properly
    with poll on Solaris.

pprocess (0.3.1-0ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * Moved the reference material out of the module docstring
    and into a separate document, converting it to XHTML in
    the process.
  * Fixed the project name in the setup script.

pprocess (0.3-0ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * Added managed callables: wrappers around callables which
    cause them to be automatically managed by the exchange
    from which they were acquired.
  * Added MakeParallel: a wrapper instantiated around a
    normal function which sends the result of that function
    over the supplied channel when invoked.
  * Added MakeReusable: a wrapper like MakeParallel which
    can be used in conjunction with the newly-added reuse
    capability of the Exchange class in order to reuse
    processes and channels.
  * Added a Map class which attempts to emulate the built-in
    map function, along with a pmap function using this
    class.
  * Added a Queue class which provides a simpler
    iterator-style interface to data produced by created
    processes.
  * Added a create method to the Exchange class and an exit
    convenience function to the module.
  * Changed the Exchange implementation to not block when
    attempting to start new processes beyond the process
    limit: such requests are queued and performed as running
    processes are completed. This permits programs using
    the start method to proceed to consumption of results
    more quickly.
  * Extended and updated the examples. Added a tutorial.
  * Added Ubuntu Feisty (7.04) package support.

parallel-pprocess (0.2.5-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added a start method to the Exchange class for more
    convenient creation of processes.
  * Relicensed under the LGPL (version 3 or later) - this
    also fixes the contradictory situation where the GPL was
    stated in the pprocess module (which was not, in fact,
    the intention) and the LGPL was stated in the
    documentation.

parallel-pprocess (0.2.4-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Set buffer sizes to zero for the file object wrappers
    around sockets: this may prevent deadlock issues.

 -- Paul Boddie <paul@boddie.org.uk>  Thu, 29 Mar 2007 01:50:13 +0200

parallel-pprocess (0.2.3-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added convenient message exchanges, offering methods
    handling common situations at the cost of having to
    define a subclass of Exchange.
  * Added a simple example of performing a parallel
    computation.
  * Improved the PyGmy raytracer example to use the newly
    added functionality.

parallel-pprocess (0.2.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Changed the status testing in the Exchange class,
    potentially fixing the premature closure of channels
    before all data was read.
  * Fixed the PyGmy raytracer example's process accounting
    by relying on the possibly more reliable Exchange
    behaviour, whilst also preventing erroneous creation of
    "out of bounds" processes.
  * Added a removed attribute on the Exchange to record
    which channels were removed in the last call to the
    ready method.

parallel-pprocess (0.2.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Added a PyGmy raytracer example.
  * Updated copyright and licensing details (FSF address,
    additional works).

parallel-pprocess (0.2-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Changed the parallel module to pprocess.

parallel-module (0.1-0ubuntu1) hoary; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
