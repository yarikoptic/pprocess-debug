Notes on the Inclusion of PyGmy
-------------------------------

PyGmy is included in this distribution of parallel/pprocess as an independent
demonstration of the pprocess library's facilities. This distribution is thus
considered as an aggregation of the two works, with separate licences
governing each work.
