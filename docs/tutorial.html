<h1>pprocess - Tutorial</h1>

<p>The <code>pprocess</code> module provides several mechanisms for running
Python code concurrently in several processes. The most straightforward way of
making a program parallel-aware - that is, where the program can take
advantage of more than one processor to simultaneously process data - is to
use the <code>pmap</code> function.</p>

<p>For a brief summary of each of the features of <code>pprocess</code>, see
the <a href="reference.html">reference document</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pmap">Converting Map-Style Code</h2>

<p>Consider a program using the built-in <code>map</code> function and a sequence of inputs:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise an array.

    sequence = []
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            sequence.append((i, j))

    # Perform the work.

    results = map(calculate, sequence)

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_map.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>The principal features of this program involve the preparation of an array
for input purposes, and the use of the <code>map</code> function to iterate
over the combinations of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> in the array. Even
if the <code>calculate</code> function could be invoked independently for each
input value, we have to wait for each computation to complete before
initiating a new one. The <code>calculate</code> function may be defined as
follows:</p>

<pre>
def calculate(t):

    "A supposedly time-consuming calculation on 't'."

    i, j = t
    time.sleep(delay)
    return i * N + j
</pre>

<p>In order to reduce the processing time - to speed the code up, in other
words - we can make this code use several processes instead of just one. Here
is the modified code:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise an array.

    sequence = []
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            sequence.append((i, j))

    # Perform the work.

    results = <strong>pprocess.pmap</strong>(calculate, sequence<strong>, limit=limit</strong>)

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_pmap.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>By replacing usage of the <code>map</code> function with the
<code>pprocess.pmap</code> function, and specifying the limit on the number of
processes to be active at any given time (the value of the <code>limit</code>
variable is defined elsewhere), several calculations can now be performed in
parallel.</p>

<h2 id="Map">Converting Invocations to Parallel Operations</h2>

<p>Although some programs make natural use of the <code>map</code> function,
others may employ an invocation in a nested loop. This may also be converted
to a parallel program. Consider the following Python code:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise an array.

    results = []

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            results.append(calculate(i, j))

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple1.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>Here, a computation in the <code>calculate</code> function is performed for
each combination of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> in the nested loop,
returning a result value. However, we must wait for the completion of this
function for each element before moving on to the next element, and this means
that the computations are performed sequentially. Consequently, on a system
with more than one processor, even if we could call <code>calculate</code> for
more than one combination of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code><code></code>
and have the computations executing at the same time, the above program will
not take advantage of such capabilities.</p>

<p>We use a slightly modified version of <code>calculate</code> which employs
two parameters instead of one:</p>

<pre>
def calculate(i, j):

    """
    A supposedly time-consuming calculation on 'i' and 'j'.
    """

    time.sleep(delay)
    return i * N + j
</pre>

<p>In order to reduce the processing time - to speed the code up, in other
words - we can make this code use several processes instead of just one. Here
is the modified code:</p>

<pre id="simple_managed_map">
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the results using a map with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    <strong>results = pprocess.Map(limit=limit)</strong><code></code>

    # Wrap the calculate function and manage it.

    <strong>calc = results.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate))</strong>

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            <strong>calc</strong>(i, j)

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_managed_map.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>The principal changes in the above code involve the use of a
<code>pprocess.Map</code> object to collect the results, and a version of the
<code>calculate</code> function which is managed by the <code>Map</code>
object. What the <code>Map</code> object does is to arrange the results of
computations such that iterating over the object or accessing the object using
list operations provides the results in the same order as their corresponding
inputs.</p>

<h2 id="Queue">Converting Arbitrarily-Ordered Invocations</h2>

<p>In some programs, it is not important to receive the results of
computations in any particular order, usually because either the order of
these results is irrelevant, or because the results provide "positional"
information which let them be handled in an appropriate way. Consider the
following Python code:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise an array.

    results = [0] * N * N

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            i2, j2, result = calculate(i, j)
            results[i2*N+j2] = result

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple2.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>Here, a result array is initialised first and each computation is performed
sequentially. A significant difference to the previous examples is the return
value of the <code>calculate</code> function: the position details
corresponding to <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are returned alongside the
result. Obviously, this is of limited value in the above code because the
order of the computations and the reception of results is fixed. However, we
get no benefit from parallelisation in the above example.</p>

<p>We can bring the benefits of parallel processing to the above program with
the following code:</p>

<pre id="simple_managed_queue">
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the communications queue with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    <strong>queue = pprocess.Queue(limit=limit)</strong>

    # Initialise an array.

    results = [0] * N * N

    # Wrap the calculate function and manage it.

    <strong>calc = queue.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate))</strong>

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            <strong>calc(i, j)</strong>

    # Store the results as they arrive.

    print "Finishing..."
    <strong>for i, j, result in queue:</strong>
        <strong>results[i*N+j] = result</strong>

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_managed_queue.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>This revised code employs a <code>pprocess.Queue</code> object whose
purpose is to collect the results of computations and to make them available
in the order in which they were received. The code collecting results has been
moved into a separate loop independent of the original computation loop and
taking advantage of the more relevant "positional" information emerging from
the queue.</p>

<p>We can take this example further, illustrating some of the mechanisms
employed by <code>pprocess</code>. Instead of collecting results in a queue,
we can define a class containing a method which is called when new results
arrive:</p>

<pre>
class MyExchange(pprocess.Exchange):

    "Parallel convenience class containing the array assignment operation."

    def store_data(self, ch):
        i, j, result = ch.receive()
        self.D[i*N+j] = result
</pre>

<p>This code exposes the channel paradigm which is used throughout
<code>pprocess</code> and is available to applications, if desired. The effect
of the method is the storage of a result received through the channel in an
attribute of the object. The following code shows how this class can be used,
with differences to the previous program illustrated:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the communications exchange with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    <strong>exchange = MyExchange(limit=limit)</strong>

    # Initialise an array - it is stored in the exchange to permit automatic
    # assignment of values as the data arrives.

    <strong>results = exchange.D = [0] * N * N</strong>

    # Wrap the calculate function and manage it.

    calc = <strong>exchange</strong>.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate))

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            calc(i, j)

    # Wait for the results.

    print "Finishing..."
    <strong>exchange.finish()</strong>

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_managed.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>The main visible differences between this and the previous program are the
storage of the result array in the exchange, the removal of the queue
consumption code from the main program, placing the act of storing values in
the exchange's <code>store_data</code> method, and the need to call the
<code>finish</code> method on the <code>MyExchange</code> object so that we do
not try and access the results too soon. One underlying benefit not visible in
the above code is that we no longer need to accumulate results in a queue or
other structure so that they may be processed and assigned to the correct
positions in the result array.</p>

<p>For the curious, we may remove some of the remaining conveniences of the
above program to expose other features of <code>pprocess</code>. First, we
define a slightly modified version of the <code>calculate</code> function:</p>

<pre>
def calculate(ch, i, j):

    """
    A supposedly time-consuming calculation on 'i' and 'j', using 'ch' to
    communicate with the parent process.
    """

    time.sleep(delay)
    ch.send((i, j, i * N + j))
</pre>

<p>This function accepts a channel, <code>ch</code>, through which results
will be sent, and through which other values could potentially be received,
although we choose not to do so here. The program using this function is as
follows, with differences to the previous program illustrated:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the communications exchange with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    exchange = MyExchange(limit=limit)

    # Initialise an array - it is stored in the exchange to permit automatic
    # assignment of values as the data arrives.

    results = exchange.D = [0] * N * N

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            <strong>exchange.start(calculate, i, j)</strong>

    # Wait for the results.

    print "Finishing..."
    exchange.finish()

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_start.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>Here, we have discarded two conveniences: the wrapping of callables using
<code>MakeParallel</code>, which lets us use functions without providing any
channel parameters, and the management of callables using the
<code>manage</code> method on queues, exchanges, and so on. The
<code>start</code> method still calls the provided callable, but using a
different notation from that employed previously.</p>

<h2 id="create">Converting Inline Computations</h2>

<p>Although many programs employ functions and other useful abstractions which
can be treated as parallelisable units, some programs perform computations
"inline", meaning that the code responsible appears directly within a loop or
related control-flow construct. Consider the following code:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise an array.

    results = [0] * N * N

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            time.sleep(delay)
            results[i*N+j] = i * N + j

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>To simulate "work", as in the different versions of the
<code>calculate</code> function, we use the <code>time.sleep</code> function
(which does not actually do work, and which will cause a process to be
descheduled in most cases, but which simulates the delay associated with work
being done). This inline work, which must be performed sequentially in the
above program, can be performed in parallel in a somewhat modified version of
the program:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the results using a map with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    <strong>results = pprocess.Map(limit=limit)</strong>

    # Perform the work.
    # NOTE: Could use the with statement in the loop to package the
    # NOTE: try...finally functionality.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            <strong>ch = results.create()</strong>
            <strong>if ch:</strong>
                <strong>try: # Calculation work.</strong>

                    time.sleep(delay)
                    <strong>ch.send(i * N + j)</strong>

                <strong>finally: # Important finalisation.</strong>

                    <strong>pprocess.exit(ch)</strong>

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_create_map.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>Although seemingly more complicated, the bulk of the changes in this
modified program are focused on obtaining a channel object, <code>ch</code>,
at the point where the computations are performed, and the wrapping of the
computation code in a <code>try</code>...<code>finally</code> statement which
ensures that the process associated with the channel exits when the
computation is complete. In order for the results of these computations to be
collected, a <code>pprocess.Map</code> object is used, since it will maintain
the results in the same order as the initiation of the computations which
produced them.</p>

<h2 id="MakeReusable">Reusing Processes in Parallel Programs</h2>

<p>One notable aspect of the above programs when parallelised is that each
invocation of a computation in parallel creates a new process in which the
computation is to be performed, regardless of whether existing processes had
just finished producing results and could theoretically have been asked to
perform new computations. In other words, processes were created and destroyed
instead of being reused.</p>

<p>However, we can request that processes be reused for computations by
enabling the <code>reuse</code> feature of exchange-like objects and employing
suitable reusable callables. Consider this modified version of the <a
href="#simple_managed_map">simple_managed_map</a> program:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the results using a map with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    results = pprocess.Map(limit=limit<strong>, reuse=1</strong>)

    # Wrap the calculate function and manage it.

    calc = results.manage(pprocess.Make<strong>Reusable</strong>(calculate))

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            calc(i, j)

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_manage_map_reusable.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>By indicating that processes and channels shall be reused, and by wrapping
the <code>calculate</code> function with the necessary support, the
computations may be performed in parallel using a pool of processes instead of
creating a new process for each computation and then discarding it, only to
create a new process for the next computation.</p>

<h2 id="BackgroundCallable">Performing Computations in Background Processes</h2>

<p>Occasionally, it is desirable to initiate time-consuming computations and to
not only leave such processes running in the background, but to be able to detach
the creating process from them completely, potentially terminating the creating
process altogether, and yet also be able to collect the results of the created
processes at a later time, potentially in another completely different process.
For such situations, we can make use of the <code>BackgroundCallable</code>
class, which converts a parallel-aware callable into a callable which will run
in a background process when invoked.</p>

<p>Consider this excerpt from a modified version of the <a
href="#simple_managed_queue">simple_managed_queue</a> program:</p>

<pre>
<strong>def task():</strong>

    # Initialise the communications queue with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    queue = pprocess.Queue(limit=limit)

    # Initialise an array.

    results = [0] * N * N

    # Wrap the calculate function and manage it.

    calc = queue.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate))

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            calc(i, j)

    # Store the results as they arrive.

    print "Finishing..."
    for i, j, result in queue:
        results[i*N+j] = result

    <strong>return results</strong>
</pre>

<p>Here, we have converted the main program into a function, and instead of
printing out the results, we return the results list from the function.</p>

<p>Now, let us consider the new main program (with the relevant mechanisms
highlighted):</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    if "--reconnect" not in sys.argv:

        # Wrap the computation and manage it.

        <strong>ptask = pprocess.BackgroundCallable("task.socket", pprocess.MakeParallel(task))</strong>

        # Perform the work.

        ptask()

        # Discard the callable.

        del ptask
        print "Discarded the callable."

    if "--start" not in sys.argv:

        # Open a queue and reconnect to the task.

        print "Opening a queue."
        <strong>queue = pprocess.BackgroundQueue("task.socket")</strong>

        # Wait for the results.

        print "Waiting for persistent results"
        for results in queue:
            pass # should only be one element

        # Show the results.

        for i in range(0, N):
            for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
                print result,
            print

        print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_background_queue.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>This new main program has two parts: the part which initiates the
computation, and the part which connects to the computation in order to collect
the results. Both parts can be run in the same process, and this should result
in similar behaviour to that of the original
<a href="#simple_managed_queue">simple_managed_queue</a> program.</p>

<p>In the above program, however, we are free to specify <code>--start</code> as
an option when running the program, and the result of this is merely to initiate
the computation in a background process, using <code>BackgroundCallable</code>
to obtain a callable which, when invoked, creates the background process and
runs the computation. After doing this, the program will then exit, but it will
leave the computation running as a collection of background processes, and a
special file called <code>task.socket</code> will exist in the current working
directory.</p>

<p>When the above program is run using the <code>--reconnect</code> option, an
attempt will be made to reconnect to the background processes already created by
attempting to contact them using the previously created <code>task.socket</code>
special file (which is, in fact, a UNIX-domain socket); this being done using
the <code>BackgroundQueue</code> function which will handle the incoming results
in a fashion similar to that of a <code>Queue</code> object. Since only one
result is returned by the computation (as defined by the <code>return</code>
statement in the <code>task</code> function), we need only expect one element to
be collected by the queue: a list containing all of the results produced in the
computation.</p>

<h2 id="ManagingBackgroundProcesses">Managing Several Background Processes</h2>

<p>In the above example, a single background process was used to manage a number
of other processes, with all of them running in the background. However, it can
be desirable to manage more than one background process.</p>

<p>Consider this excerpt from a modified version of the <a
href="#simple_managed_queue">simple_managed_queue</a> program:</p>

<pre>
<strong>def task(i):</strong>

    # Initialise the communications queue with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    queue = pprocess.Queue(limit=limit)

    # Initialise an array.

    results = [0] * N

    # Wrap the calculate function and manage it.

    calc = queue.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate))

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    <strong>for j in range(0, N):</strong>
        <strong>calc(i, j)</strong>

    # Store the results as they arrive.

    print "Finishing..."
    <strong>for i, j, result in queue:</strong>
        <strong>results[j] = result</strong>

    <strong>return i, results</strong>
</pre>

<p>Just as we see in the previous example, a function called <code>task</code>
has been defined to hold a background computation, and this function returns a
portion of the results. However, unlike the previous example or the original
example, the scope of the results of the computation collected in the function
have been changed: here, only results for calculations involving a certain value
of <code>i</code> are collected, with the particular value of <code>i</code>
returned along with the appropriate portion of the results.</p>

<p>Now, let us consider the new main program (with the relevant mechanisms
highlighted):</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_persistent_queue.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>In the first section, the process of making a parallel-aware callable is as
expected, but instead of then invoking a single background version of such a
callable, as in the previous example, we create a version for each value of
<code>i</code> (using <code>BackgroundCallable</code>) and then invoke each one.
The result of this is a total of <code>N</code> background processes, each
running an invocation of the <code>task</code> function with a distinct value of
<code>i</code> (which in turn perform computations), and each employing a
UNIX-domain socket for communication with a name of the form
<code>task-<em>i</em>.socket</code>.</p>

<p>In the second section, since we now have more than one background process, we
must find a way to monitor them after reconnecting to them; to achieve this, a
<code>PersistentQueue</code> is created, which acts like a regular
<code>Queue</code> object but is instead focused on handling persistent
communications. Upon connecting the queue to each of the previously created
UNIX-domain sockets, the queue acts like a regular <code>Queue</code> and
exposes received results through an iterator. Here, the principal difference
from previous examples is the structure of results: instead of collecting each
individual value in a flat <code>i</code> by <code>j</code> array, a list is
returned for each value of <code>i</code> and is stored directly in another
list.</p>

<h3>Applications of Background Computations</h3>

<p>Background computations are useful because they provide flexibility in the
way the results can be collected. One area in which they can be useful is Web
programming, where a process handling an incoming HTTP request may need to
initiate a computation but then immediately send output to the Web client - such
as a page indicating that the computation is "in progress" - without having to
wait for the computation or to allocate resources to monitor it. Moreover, in
some Web architectures, notably those employing the Common Gateway Interface
(CGI), it is necessary for a process handling an incoming request to terminate
before its output will be sent to clients. By using a
<code>BackgroundCallable</code>, a Web server process can initiate a
communication, and then subsequent server processes can be used to reconnect to
the background computation and to wait efficiently for results.</p>
