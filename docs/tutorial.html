<h1>pprocess - Tutorial</h1>

<p>The <code>pprocess</code> module provides several mechanisms for running
Python code concurrently in several processes. The most straightforward way of
making a program parallel-aware - that is, where the program can take
advantage of more than one processor to simultaneously process data - is to
use the <code>pmap</code> function.</p>

<h2>Converting Map-Style Code</h2>

<p>Consider a program using the built-in <code>map</code> function and a sequence of inputs:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise an array.

    sequence = []
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            sequence.append((i, j))

    # Perform the work.

    results = map(calculate, sequence)

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_map.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>The principal features of this program involve the preparation of an array
for input purposes, and the use of the <code>map</code> function to iterate
over the combinations of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> in the array. Even
if the <code>calculate</code> function could be invoked independently for each
input value, we have to wait for each computation to complete before
initiating a new one. The <code>calculate</code> function may be defined as
follows:</p>

<pre>
def calculate(t):

    "A supposedly time-consuming calculation on 't'."

    i, j = t
    time.sleep(delay)
    return i * N + j
</pre>

<p>In order to reduce the processing time - to speed the code up, in other
words - we can make this code use several processes instead of just one. Here
is the modified code:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise an array.

    sequence = []
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            sequence.append((i, j))

    # Perform the work.

    results = <strong>pprocess.pmap</strong>(calculate, sequence<strong>, limit=limit</strong>)

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_pmap.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>By replacing usage of the <code>map</code> function with the
<code>pprocess.pmap</code> function, and specifying the limit on the number of
processes to be active at any given time (the value of the <code>limit</code>
variable is defined elsewhere), several calculations can now be performed in
parallel.</p>

<h2>Converting Invocations to Parallel Operations</h2>

<p>Although some programs make natural use of the <code>map</code> function,
others may employ an invocation in a nested loop. This may also be converted
to a parallel program. Consider the following Python code:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise an array.

    results = []

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            results.append(calculate(i, j))

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple1.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>Here, a computation in the <code>calculate</code> function is performed for
each combination of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> in the nested loop,
returning a result value. However, we must wait for the completion of this
function for each element before moving on to the next element, and this means
that the computations are performed sequentially. Consequently, on a system
with more than one processor, even if we could call <code>calculate</code> for
more than one combination of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code><code></code>
and have the computations executing at the same time, the above program will
not take advantage of such capabilities.</p>

<p>We use a slightly modified version of <code>calculate</code> which employs
two parameters instead of one:</p>

<pre>
def calculate(i, j):

    """
    A supposedly time-consuming calculation on 'i' and 'j'.
    """

    time.sleep(delay)
    return i * N + j
</pre>

<p>In order to reduce the processing time - to speed the code up, in other
words - we can make this code use several processes instead of just one. Here
is the modified code:</p>

<pre id="simple_managed_map">
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the results using a map with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    <strong>results = pprocess.Map(limit=limit)</strong><code></code>

    # Wrap the calculate function and manage it.

    <strong>calc = results.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate))</strong>

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            <strong>calc</strong>(i, j)

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_managed_map.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>The principal changes in the above code involve the use of a
<code>pprocess.Map</code> object to collect the results, and a version of the
<code>calculate</code> function which is managed by the <code>Map</code>
object. What the <code>Map</code> object does is to arrange the results of
computations such that iterating over the object or accessing the object using
list operations provides the results in the same order as their corresponding
inputs.</p>

<h2>Converting Arbitrarily-Ordered Invocations</h2>

<p>In some programs, it is not important to receive the results of
computations in any particular order, usually because either the order of
these results is irrelevant, or because the results provide "positional"
information which let them be handled in an appropriate way. Consider the
following Python code:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise an array.

    results = [0] * N * N

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            i2, j2, result = calculate(i, j)
            results[i2*N+j2] = result

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple2.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>Here, a result array is initialised first and each computation is performed
sequentially. A significant difference to the previous examples is the return
value of the <code>calculate</code> function: the position details
corresponding to <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are returned alongside the
result. Obviously, this is of limited value in the above code because the
order of the computations and the reception of results is fixed. However, we
get no benefit from parallelisation in the above example.</p>

<p>We can bring the benefits of parallel processing to the above program with
the following code:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the communications queue with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    <strong>queue = pprocess.Queue(limit=limit)</strong>

    # Initialise an array.

    results = [0] * N * N

    # Wrap the calculate function and manage it.

    <strong>calc = queue.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate))</strong>

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            <strong>calc(i, j)</strong>

    # Store the results as they arrive.

    print "Finishing..."
    <strong>for i, j, result in queue:</strong>
        <strong>results[i*N+j] = result</strong>

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_managed_queue.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>This revised code employs a <code>pprocess.Queue</code> object whose
purpose is to collect the results of computations and to make them available
in the order in which they were received. The code collecting results has been
moved into a separate loop independent of the original computation loop and
taking advantage of the more relevant "positional" information emerging from
the queue.</p>

<p>We can take this example further, illustrating some of the mechanisms
employed by <code>pprocess</code>. Instead of collecting results in a queue,
we can define a class containing a method which is called when new results
arrive:</p>

<pre>
class MyExchange(pprocess.Exchange):

    "Parallel convenience class containing the array assignment operation."

    def store_data(self, ch):
        i, j, result = ch.receive()
        self.D[i*N+j] = result
</pre>

<p>This code exposes the channel paradigm which is used throughout
<code>pprocess</code> and is available to applications, if desired. The effect
of the method is the storage of a result received through the channel in an
attribute of the object. The following code shows how this class can be used,
with differences to the previous program illustrated:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the communications exchange with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    <strong>exchange = MyExchange(limit=limit)</strong>

    # Initialise an array - it is stored in the exchange to permit automatic
    # assignment of values as the data arrives.

    <strong>results = exchange.D = [0] * N * N</strong>

    # Wrap the calculate function and manage it.

    calc = <strong>exchange</strong>.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate))

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            calc(i, j)

    # Wait for the results.

    print "Finishing..."
    <strong>exchange.finish()</strong>

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_managed.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>The main visible differences between this and the previous program are the
storage of the result array in the exchange, the removal of the queue
consumption code from the main program, placing the act of storing values in
the exchange's <code>store_data</code> method, and the need to call the
<code>finish</code> method on the <code>MyExchange</code> object so that we do
not try and access the results too soon. One underlying benefit not visible in
the above code is that we no longer need to accumulate results in a queue or
other structure so that they may be processed and assigned to the correct
positions in the result array.</p>

<p>For the curious, we may remove some of the remaining conveniences of the
above program to expose other features of <code>pprocess</code>. First, we
define a slightly modified version of the <code>calculate</code> function:</p>

<pre>
def calculate(ch, i, j):

    """
    A supposedly time-consuming calculation on 'i' and 'j', using 'ch' to
    communicate with the parent process.
    """

    time.sleep(delay)
    ch.send((i, j, i * N + j))
</pre>

<p>This function accepts a channel, <code>ch</code>, through which results
will be sent, and through which other values could potentially be received,
although we choose not to do so here. The program using this function is as
follows, with differences to the previous program illustrated:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the communications exchange with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    exchange = MyExchange(limit=limit)

    # Initialise an array - it is stored in the exchange to permit automatic
    # assignment of values as the data arrives.

    results = exchange.D = [0] * N * N

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            <strong>exchange.start(calculate, i, j)</strong>

    # Wait for the results.

    print "Finishing..."
    exchange.finish()

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_start.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>Here, we have discarded two conveniences: the wrapping of callables using
<code>MakeParallel</code>, which lets us use functions without providing any
channel parameters, and the management of callables using the
<code>manage</code> method on queues, exchanges, and so on. The
<code>start</code> method still calls the provided callable, but using a
different notation from that employed previously.</p>

<h2>Converting Inline Computations</h2>

<p>Although many programs employ functions and other useful abstractions which
can be treated as parallelisable units, some programs perform computations
"inline", meaning that the code responsible appears directly within a loop or
related control-flow construct. Consider the following code:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise an array.

    results = [0] * N * N

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            time.sleep(delay)
            results[i*N+j] = i * N + j

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>To simulate "work", as in the different versions of the
<code>calculate</code> function, we use the <code>time.sleep</code> function
(which does not actually do work, and which will cause a process to be
descheduled in most cases, but which simulates the delay associated with work
being done). This inline work, which must be performed sequentially in the
above program, can be performed in parallel in a somewhat modified version of
the program:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the results using a map with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    <strong>results = pprocess.Map(limit=limit)</strong>

    # Perform the work.
    # NOTE: Could use the with statement in the loop to package the
    # NOTE: try...finally functionality.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            <strong>ch = results.create()</strong>
            <strong>if ch:</strong>
                <strong>try: # Calculation work.</strong>

                    time.sleep(delay)
                    <strong>ch.send(i * N + j)</strong>

                <strong>finally: # Important finalisation.</strong>

                    <strong>pprocess.exit(ch)</strong>

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_create_map.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>Although seemingly more complicated, the bulk of the changes in this
modified program are focused on obtaining a channel object, <code>ch</code>,
at the point where the computations are performed, and the wrapping of the
computation code in a <code>try</code>...<code>finally</code> statement which
ensures that the process associated with the channel exits when the
computation is complete. In order for the results of these computations to be
collected, a <code>pprocess.Map</code> object is used, since it will maintain
the results in the same order as the initiation of the computations which
produced them.</p>

<h2>Reusing Processes in Parallel Programs</h2>

<p>One notable aspect of the above programs when parallelised is that each
invocation of a computation in parallel creates a new process in which the
computation is to be performed, regardless of whether existing processes had
just finished producing results and could theoretically have been asked to
perform new computations. In other words, processes were created and destroyed
instead of being reused.</p>

<p>However, we can request that processes be reused for computations by
enabling the <code>reuse</code> feature of exchange-like objects and employing
suitable reusable callables. Consider this modified version of the <a
href="#simple_managed_map">simple_managed_map</a> program:</p>

<pre>
    t = time.time()

    # Initialise the results using a map with a limit on the number of
    # channels/processes.

    results = pprocess.Map(limit=limit<strong>, reuse=1</strong>)

    # Wrap the calculate function and manage it.

    calc = results.manage(pprocess.Make<strong>Reusable</strong>(calculate))

    # Perform the work.

    print "Calculating..."
    for i in range(0, N):
        for j in range(0, N):
            calc(i, j)

    # Show the results.

    for i in range(0, N):
        for result in results[i*N:i*N+N]:
            print result,
        print

    print "Time taken:", time.time() - t
</pre>

<p>(This code in context with <code>import</code> statements and functions is
found in the <code>examples/simple_manage_map_reusable.py</code> file.)</p>

<p>By indicating that processes and channels shall be reused, and by wrapping
the <code>calculate</code> function with the necessary support, the
computations may be performed in parallel using a pool of processes instead of
creating a new process for each computation and then discarding it, only to
create a new process for the next computation.</p>
