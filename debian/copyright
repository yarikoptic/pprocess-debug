Notes on the Inclusion of PyGmy:

    PyGmy is included in  this distribution of parallel/pprocess as an
    independent    demonstration    of    the    pprocess    library's
    facilities. This distribution is thus considered as an aggregation
    of the two works, with separate licences governing each work.
