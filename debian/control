Description: Elementary parallel programming for Python
 The  pprocess   module  provides  elementary   support  for  parallel
 programming in  Python using a  fork-based process creation  model in
 conjunction  with a  channel-based  communications model  implemented
 using socketpair and poll. On systems with multiple CPUs or multicore
 CPUs, processes should take advantage of as many CPUs or cores as the
 operating system permits.
