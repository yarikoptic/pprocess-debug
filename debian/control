Description: elementary parallel programming for Python
 The pprocess module provides elementary support for parallel programming in
 Python using a fork-based process creation model in conjunction with a
 channel-based communications model implemented using socketpair and poll. On
 systems with multiple CPUs or multicore CPUs, processes should take advantage
 of as many CPUs or cores as the operating system permits.
